        more_des: <p>
            By default, the animation keeps track of the nearest scrollable element, 
            (meaning when you set trigger to "onscroll" or "inview", we seek out the nearest scrollable element and make the animation to respond to it)


            <br />
            <br />
            However, If you have a specific scrollable element and you want the animation to 
            respond to this scrollable element, add a class name or id (for example: "container"),
            then set scrollingElement to that class name or id (like this scrollingElement=".container"), 
            you can also use specific tag names like: "html", "body", "nav", "div", "p", "a", "div.thisClass", "p.thisparagraph", "p#thisID", "#thisSpecificID". (or anything related)
            <br />
            <br />
            Note: This is only useful if you want to trigger your scroll animaton based a specific scrollable element, otherwise, just ignore it, it would respond to the nearest scrollable parent element.

        more_des: <p>
            The underlying TextEngine template used in building this component is an extremely dynamic one, its built using gsap.
            <br />
            <br />
            The idea is to help you abstract the many lines of code you need to do stuffs with gsap (while dealing with texts)
            <br />
            <br />
            With the extendAnimation prop, you can completely transform the entire outlook of the component.
            <br />
            By default, the animation in the engine is basically to transform the opacity from 0 to 1, you can overwrite this by setting the opacity to [1,1] (with extendAnimation),
            You can also add more properties to style, for example if you have a big bold text, you can enlarge (scale) each character, word, lines, etc, as it fully reveals (scale: [0, 1]).
            <br />
            You can really do much more, its up to you.

            With the extendAnimation prop, you can completely transform the entire outlook of the component.
            <br />
            <br />
            Also with the timeline and scrolltrigger props, you can do much more, like play and pause the animation whenever you want, control the sequence of the animation, and so much more
            <br />
            <br />
            I recommend that you have a basic knowledge of gsap, it would really make a difference.
