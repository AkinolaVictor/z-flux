                    Z-Flux is an open-source collection of beautifully crafted, event-driven web components designed to make interfaces feel alive. Every component is built to respond naturally to user interactions—from scrolling and cursor movement to clicks, gestures, and viewport changes—creating experiences that are both engaging and intuitive.

                <p className='mb-5 opacity-80 text-[14px]'>
                    Unlike traditional UI libraries focused on standard interface elements, Z-Flux is dedicated to motion, interaction, and visual storytelling. Whether you're adding immersive text effects, seamless page transitions, interactive cursors, or dynamic content animations, every component is designed to elevate the way users experience your website.
